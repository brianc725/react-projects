# react-projects
Various projects for practicing my skills in React.

## Project 1 - clicker
A simple "clicker" app to practice state and setting state. You can use the buttons to add 1, subtract 1, or reset back to 0. 

## Project 2 - movie-cards
A simple React website playing around with more Reactstrap components such as the card. It uses data from the free open movie api to gather information on movies and present the information. Future updates include adding a movie to the list and clicking a movie for more detailed information.
